# TPMS Lattice Generator (LattGen)
The TPMS Lattice Generator (LattGen) is a tool that allows you to create and manipulate Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) lattices. TPMS are three-dimensional shapes that repeat themselves in three directions, possessing the unique property of having the smallest possible surface area for a given local volume. They have applications in aerospace engineering, biomedical engineering, structural weight reduction, and impact absorption. With this tool, you can generate up to 30 predefined TPMS patterns with uniform density, graded density or hybridization properties. Furthermore, it facilitates the import of existing meshes for lattice integration and enables the export of the resulting object as an STL file.
